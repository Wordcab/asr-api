# Wordcab Transcribe üí¨

FastAPI based API for transcribing audio files using [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) and [`pyannote-audio`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)

More details on this project on this [blog post](https://wordcab.github.io/wordcab-posts/blog/2023/03/31/wordcab-transcribe/).

## Key features

- ü§ó Open-source: Our project is open-source and based on open-source libraries, allowing you to customize and extend it as needed.
- ‚ö° Fast: The faster-whisper library and CTranslate2 make audio processing incredibly fast compared to other implementations.
- üê≥ Easy to deploy: You can deploy the project on your workstation or in the cloud using Docker.
- üî• Batch requests: You can transcribe multiple audio files at once because batch requests are implemented in the API.
- üí∏ Cost-effective: As an open-source solution, you won't have to pay for costly ASR platforms.
- ü´∂ Easy-to-use API: With just a few lines of code, you can use the API to transcribe audio files or even YouTube videos.

## Requirements

- Linux _(tested on Ubuntu Server 22.04)_
- Python 3.9
- Docker
- NVIDIA GPU + NVIDIA Container Toolkit

To learn more about the prerequisites to run the API, check out the [Prerequisites](https://wordcab.github.io/wordcab-posts/blog/2023/03/31/wordcab-transcribe/#prerequisites) section of the blog post.

## Docker commands

Build the image.

```bash
docker build -t wordcab-transcribe:latest .
```

Run the container.

```bash
docker run -d --name wordcab-transcribe \
    --gpus all \
    --shm-size 1g \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 5001:5001 \
    wordcab-transcribe:latest
```

Note that the container might take a few minutes to start as
it has to download the Whisper and embedding models. After
these have downloaded, the API should work. If you want to
see the progress of these downloads in your console, you can
run the above command without the `-d` flag.

If you get an error along the lines of
`Conflict. The container name "/wordcab-transcribe" is already in use by container`
try running `docker container prune` to remove any stopped containers.

## Test the API

Once the container is running, you can test the API.

The API documentation is available at [http://localhost:5001/docs](http://localhost:5001/docs).

- Audio file:

```python
import requests

headers = {"accept": "application/json"}
data = {
  "num_speakers": 1,  # optional, default is 0
  "source_lang": "en",  # optional, default is "en"
  "timestamps": "seconds",  # optional, default is "seconds"
}

filepath = "tests/sample_1.mp3"  # or any other audio file. Prefer wav files.
with open(filepath, "rb") as f:
  files = {"file": f}
  response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/api/v1/audio",
    headers=headers,
    files=files,
    data=data,
  )
print(response.json())
```

- YouTube video:

```python
import json
import requests

headers = {"accept": "application/json", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
params = {"url": "https://youtu.be/JZ696sbfPHs"}
data = {
  "num_speakers": 1,  # optional, default is 0
  "source_lang": "en",  # optional, default is "en"
  "timestamps": "seconds",  # optional, default is "seconds"
}

response = requests.post(
  "http://localhost:5001/api/v1/youtube",
  headers=headers,
  params=params,
  data=json.dumps(data),
)
print(response.json())
```

## Local testing

Before launching the API, be sure to install torch and torchaudio on your machine.

```bash
pip install --upgrade torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

Then, you can launch the API using the following command.

```bash
poetry run uvicorn wordcab_transcribe.main:app --reload
```
